HTML5 & CSS3 for the Real World: 2nd
Chapters 2 & 3
<p>In the HTML & CSS textbook (2nd edition2015) are some text elements that are not intended to affect the  structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as html semantic markup.</p>
<p>HTML elements are not used to describe the structure of  the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
Three types of HTML lists:

 Ordered lists (create an ordered list here)
   
      use numbers
      numbers increment in list
   
  


  Unordered lists (create an unordered list here)
    
      use bullets
      customizable bullets
    
  


  Definition lists (create a definition list here)
   are used to define terminology
   are customizable

Create a table like the one showing below but yours will not show border lines:

  <thead>
   
      CIT 230 Class
    
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    
      Topic
      html
    
    
      css
    
    
      javascript
    
    <tr>
      let's build some websites!
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>data compiled by &lt;type in your name&gt; in the cit230 class</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
Creating Links:
<p>Using the image below  as the folder structure, pretend that you are currently in an html document  located in the <strong>html</strong> folder. Please make <strong>relative</strong> link paths in the html code for the following  to retrieve the instructions.html document (even though you do not have that doc and it will not actually retrieve), to retrieve the instructions.html  as instructed in the names. </p>
<ul>
  <li>instructions.html--from textbook folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from html folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from html5 folder</li>
  <li>instructions.html--from css folder</li>
  <li>ordered list (create a link to go to the ordered list of this page)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</body>
</html>
