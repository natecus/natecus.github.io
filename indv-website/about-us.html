		<p>Longboards. We don’t know much, but we do know longboards here at Liberty Longboards. We’ve been at it since 2017 
			when we started making our boards in a garage with some simple homemade board presses. Then we started growing 
			and getting much better at what we do. Since then have won all kinds of sweet awards that give us excuses to 
			show off.</p>

		<p>Enough about us. Let’s talk about you… and your future in longboarding. First, some history.</p>

		<p>Longboarding originates way back to the start of skateboarding when surfers were looking for a way to cruise the streets 
			when the water was bad. While the roots are all the same and they both started as one together, longboarding and 
			skateboarding developed along different paths. In recent years, longboarding has really seen a boom in not only 
			participation but also development of products and events as well. The longboard community is unlike any other: it 
			is a community full of people that want to be active together, want to have fun together, want to go places a 
			little faster together and want to connect with each other in any way that they can. People that longboard are 
			any age, any size, and have numerous levels of education. They can be 4 years old and still in pre-school, they 
			can be flipping burgers at the local fast food spot, extracting teeth as a dentist or your mini van driving soccer
			mom. Doesn’t matter.
		</p>
		<p>If getting you’re kicks out of going sideways in excess of 35 MPH or travelling to screaming hills to top out past 
			60 is your thing, than you can go right ahead and call yourself a freerider or a downhiller. Freeride and downhill 
			skateboarders ride longboards that range from rigid but flexible to incredibly stiff and have mid-sized wheel bases
			handling both technical and speedy situations. More and more common these days is the incorporation of high end 
			precision longboard trucks, a CNC manufactured version of the turning apparatus that works hand in hand with a set 
			of spacers and washers to ensure a smooth slide while drifting or permitting an effortless rail to the inside line 
			of an incredibly fast sweeper. The need for consistency and performance is what drives these riders to upgrade to 
			these products just like car enthusiasts would add aftermarket parts to their cars. The growth and progression of 
			longboarding as a whole has surfaced so many different manufacturing companies putting a lot of effort into the 
			research and development of products like wheels and bearings to keep up with the demands of their constantly 
			progressing customers. The result is an array of products for today’s longboarder to choose from that compliments 
			just about any situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, we don’t expect everyone to be these crazy daredevils bombing big hills on a longboard. In fact, we quite 
			like the world of cruising and carving that you see on beautiful back mountain roads, city streets, college and 
			university campus’s and just about anywhere else that there is some concrete and a need to get somewhere. The 
			cruising and carving longboards of today are manufactured of high quality materials, most the time incorporating 
			materials like bamboo to give the boards a nice bouncy and comfortable feeling while rolling around the streets. 
			There are not many things more therupedic than grabbing your board and heading out the door in the middle of the 
			night to just go on a soul cruise around the quiet streets of your neighbourhood. We are happy to be carrying so 
			many products designed specifically to put a smile on someone’s face while they are cruising.
